* Inkscape Pages

Convert an inkscape document to a PDF document where each layer is a
new page.

Useful for making slideshows only in inkscape!

Just install from git:

#+begin_src bash
  pip install git+https://github.com/salotz/inkscape_pages.git
#+end_src

Tested to work with Inkscape version 1.0. The CLI for inkscape has
changed. Should be easy enough to adapt to older versions. Make an
issue if you find it doesn't work for your version.

It only does one thing which will take your svg and turn it into a
multipage pdf:

#+begin_src bash
inkscape_pages slideshow.svg
#+end_src

See the help for other options:

#+begin_src bash
inkscape_pages --help
#+end_src


** Inkscape document

The only thing you have to do to make this work in inkscape is to put
each page in a new layer. When you save the document make sure all
layers are visible. If a slide is not visible it will result in a
blank page.

The order of the stack of layers will be the order of the output top
first.
